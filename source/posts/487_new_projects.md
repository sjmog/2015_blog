# New Projects: Ralyxa and Initiative Tracker

Two new personal projects in the last year: a Ruby gem for Sinatra and Amazon Alexa, and a Dungeons and Dragons Initiative Tracker. Here's what they're about.

[Ralyxa](https://github.com/sjmog/ralyxa) is a neat DSL for working with Amazon's Alexa service. It's trivial to get set up with Ruby Alexa development. Also comes with a [simple example](https://github.com/sjmog/ralyxa_example), a [more advanced example](https://github.com/sjmog/pizza_buddy), and a [tutorial series](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/alexa/post/105df30e-9890-4a8c-9caf-5de1c8ff86cb/makers-academy-s-alexa-series-how-to-build-a-hello-world-skill-with-ruby) written and recorded for Amazon.

[D&D Initiative Tracker](https://sjmog.github.io/initiative_tracker/) is a slightly specced-up digital version of the pen and paper intiative-tracking system I use for GMing.
