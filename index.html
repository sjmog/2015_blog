    Red, Green, Refactor': that's a helpful mantra for writing your code test-first. But how long should you spend on each stage, and how can you effectively separate each stage from the other? The answer: Make it Work, then Make it Good.

  </h3>
  <p class="body post-overview__body">
    This post is about a learning Ready Position: a state of mind required for the adoption of new practices. A Ready Position is indispensable, especially when learning new behaviours that are either opposed to current behaviour, or refinements of existing behaviours. Best practice in learning programming mirrors best practice in learning musical instruments, where the utility of the 'ready position' is well-established.

  <p class="body post-overview__body">
    This is a post about how to be a better ally in support of oppressed groups. It uses feminism as the main example. It is primarily aimed at men who are aiming to become better allies to feminist women, or cisgender people who are aiming to become better allies to transgender people. Hopefully, it also applies to anyone who wants to support or advocate in legion with people who lack the cultural and lived privileges you have.

    CSS can be really hard: it's not naturally object-oriented, and it's built for a bygone era of type-only websites. Here are some tips (from a talk I gave at Makers Academy in London) to help intermediate front-end developers avoid spaghetti-ing their CSS on larger projects.

  </h3>
  <p class="body post-overview__body">
    In the previous article, we looked at what Bloom's Taxonomy was and where it is used. We began to look at ways a solid grounding in the taxonomy can help learners to scaffold their own learning (by knowing, given any specific topic, where they are in the taxonomy, and by providing a route to higher levels of proficiency), and how educators and curriculum developers use the taxonomy to craft learning objectives. In the article after this one, we will look at some of the tools we can use to construct learning scaffolds which link learning objectives together. In this article, we'll look at another aspect of the taxonomy – the Knowledge Dimension – and how we can use metacognitive knowledge to develop appropriate strategies for rapid learning. We'll also look at some examples of these strategies, and how the taxonomy helps us to select the right ones to use in particular learning contexts.

  </h3>
  <p class="body post-overview__body">
    This is a series of articles aimed at both students and educators. In three parts, we look at how Bloom's Taxonomy (1956, revised 2001) can be applied to everyday learning. In this first article, we're going to introduce the Taxonomy. In the second article, we'll look at how learners can use the theory to guide their own learning and build metacognitive skills. In the third article, we'll look at how educators can use the theory to create clear, robust, and efficient curricula.
